The Sway Array Company Website. Currently in Progress, client wanted to be able to access code during development for 
learning purposes as he wishes to maintain website after it is created. 

Website allows visitors to view company information and view galleries of the 3D models created by company. Instead of a 
static web page, swayArray.com is being upgraded to a dynamic website that displays galleries in visualy apealing 
carousels to enable more content to be in each gallery.
